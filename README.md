It outlines the vision for MFIL and the principles, processes, and parties involved in making decisions that affect the future of the network. It also describes how improvements to these rules can be proposed and ratified.

## The MFIL Vision

MFIL hopes to help storage providers solve the liquidity problem of stock computing power assets, and also hopes to help users who hold FIL to obtain income while maintaining liquidity.
